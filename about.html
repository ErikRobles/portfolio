        <p>I'm a front-end developer passionate about coding and ready to grow within your organization remotely or relocate

        <h3>WordPress</h3>
        <h6>Front-End Developer</h6>
        <p>I love PHP. I started out as a user of WordPress so it was just natural that I was curious how it all worked under
          the hood. My first two websites that I put together were based on WordPress with Bootstrap. From there, I continued
          to learn PHP and experiment with different themes using _underscores and Understrap. My WordPress Projects can
          be viewed in the "My Work" section of this site.</p>

      <div class="job job-2">
        <h3>JavaScript</h3>
        <h6>Front-End Developer</h6>
        <p>I am continuously in the process of becoming better in JavaScript. As part of my daily routine, I practice ECMAscript
          6 in all my spare time. This is important for me as it is the basis of frameworks I plan on becoming proficient
          in.

      <div class="job job-3">
        <h3>React / Angular</h3>
        <h6>Work in Progress</h6>
        <p>In keeping with my love of learning, I am learning the React library as well as the Angular6 framework. I have put
          some examples of my work in React and Angular in the "My Work" section of this portfolio site.</p>
